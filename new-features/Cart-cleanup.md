Cart Refactor
==============
We had somebody who worked in our cart/checkout area of our site. They weren't our strongest engineer and we've heard the code is rather hard to read and therefore maintain.

1. We have a task to go back to the CartService and refactor the code for maintainability.
2. They also didn't add unit tests for any of this, we need those as well.
